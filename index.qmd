# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

Cold Water Refugia, or areas within a stream that are persistently colder than surrounding areas, are critical features of wild salmon habitat throughout their range. Stream reaches with cold seeps and springs often result in much cooler water, which are increasingly important for salmon to keep cool as water temperatures have warmed. 

Since 2020, three Kenai Peninsula nonprofits - Cook Inletkeeper, Kachemak Heritage Land trust, and Kenai Watershed Forum - have worked together to identify where cold water refugia are found locally, and studied how to work with landowners to conserve them. We used cutting-edge methods to locate cold water refugia with thermal infrared imagery, a technology similar to "night vision goggles" that shows heat contrast.

We focused our research on tributaries of the Kenai and Kasilof rivers; specifically in the lower sections of streams outside of the federally protected Kenai National Wildlife refuge. Our goal was to identify land parcels that contained one or more cold water refugia features, and communicate information about these features and possible conservation strategies to land owners.

•	Comments on DEC standards; zone of influence
•	Notes from Sue for report: format to consider::: highlight what conservation actions are for each property. E.g. we reached out to the city of kenai for their comprehensive plan; sue communicated with DEC about zone of influence and their proposed changes to water temp criteria; mailers
•	
•	Executive summary + 1-2 pages methods, then appendix details actions for spot in each watershed.
•	Audience::: agency folks, landowners who want details; repository manager; land managers (e.g. CIRI)
•	E.g.:: ADFG has to bless water science for DNR to use it
•	outline future steps, how to build on this
•	e.g., how nice that USFWS has followed our lead


future directions
-	build relationship w/ USFWS pilot for TIR imagery
-	commission tool to notify when KPB parcels change hands
-	which of the 20ish M2S systems would be most valuable to get additional TIR data?
o	Systems w/ gravel development
o	Which rivers are zoned for mining?
o	Are there systems where old gravel extractions need reclaiming?
	Contact Robert R
literature on how material excavation affects groundwater inputs?

 - model upstream migration in context of cwr
 - use of cwr decreased sublethal exposure accumulation
 - Mean percent energy loss attributed
to future warmer mainstem temperatures was at least two times larger than
the difference in energy used in simulations without CWRs for steelhead and
salmon.
- cwrs defined by EPA as mean August discharge >0.28 m3/s (~10 cubic feet per second)
estimated as likely to provide adequate depths and volumes
for thermoregulation of adult salmon and steelhead for tributary
and plume components (https://www.epa.gov/columbiariver/columbia-river-cold-water-refuges-plan)
 - "we defined a cold-water refuge as a location that had a temperature threshold of 2C less than that of the Columbia River at some time during the adult salmon and steelhead
migration."
 --> probably not defined for juveniles ...anywhere?!?!
