    "text": "From Thermal Infrared Imagery to Conservation Actions\nCold Water Refugia, or areas within a stream that are persistently colder than surrounding areas, are critical features of wild salmon habitat throughout their range. Stream reaches with cold seeps and springs often result in much cooler water, which are increasingly important for wild salmon to keep cool as water temperatures in many streams have warmed. Some human activities can diminish or extinguish cold water refugia, such as groundwater withdrawl and construction of impervious surfaces. To conserve cold water refugia these sites must first be mapped and identified, and land owners and managers must understand best practices for their conservation.\nSince 2020, three nonprofits - Cook Inletkeeper, Kachemak Heritage Land trust, and Kenai Watershed Forum - have worked together to identify where cold water refugia are found in the Kenai Peninsula lowlands, a region where productive wild salmon habitat intersects with a growing development footprint. We used cutting-edge methods to locate cold water refugia with thermal infrared imagery, a technology similar to night vision goggles that shows heat contrast. Our resulting “treasure map” of cold water refugia locations is a valuable tool for prioritizing conservation and outreach efforts.\nIn this project we focused our research on tributaries of the Kenai and Kasilof rivers; specifically in the lower sections of streams outside of the federally protected Kenai National Wildlife refuge as outlined in the Mountains to Sea planning document (Morton et al. 2015). Our goals with this project were:\n\nIdentify land parcels that contain one or more cold water refugia features, and communicate information about these features and possible conservation strategies to land owners\nUse a variety of techniques to communicate our results to over sixty landowners, agencies, and organizations\n\nConservation actions that will result from these efforts include parcel acquisition and conservation easements, voluntary compliance, stewardship and restoration projects, and voluntary land agreements or exchanges."

    "section": "The Future",
    "text": "The Future\nOur efforts in applying thermal imagery data for conservation purposes highlights the value of recognizing cold water refugia as an asset for wild salmon habitat (Snyder et al. 2022). The work described here can continue to expand into additional territiories: there are twenty river corridors of conservation priority described in the Mountains to Sea plan, while we possess aerial thermal infrared imagery on just five (the Anchor river plus the four rivers described in this report) (Mauger, McCarty, et al. 2015).\nBeyond gathering additional thermal infrared imagery data in order for the work of conserving cold water refugia to have a sustained and widespread impact beyond this project we recommend that future efforts develop Alaska-specific technical and legal definitions, and applying them towards management needs.\nTwo examples of potential applications follow:\n\nExample: Source Water Protection Areas\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) defines “Source Water Protection Areas” for groundwater sources used for drinking water, which delineate geographic areas that contribute to the drinking water supply1. Similar logic could apply towards defining the extent of riparian landscape that supplies cold water refugia. Researchers with Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (KBNERR) in Homer, Alaska recently demonstrated that the extent of land that recharges cold water refugia can be delineated by use of a GIS-based model(Gerlach et al. 2021).\nAs of winter 2022 the Kenai Peninsula Borough is currently in the process of reviewing its permitting process for material extraction sites (i.e. gravel pits). Initial discussions between the the Borough and KBNERR have included the possibility of permit reviewers being able to use their maps of subterranean aquifer flow paths to comment on proposed development plans. This cooperation could help ensure that future development minimizes impact on the aquifers that supply cold water refugia, in the same way that defining Source Water Protection Areas help protect drinking water sources.\n\n\nExample: Columbia River Cold Water Refugia\nIn an example from the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest, the U.S. EPA has taken detailed steps to identify, define, and recommend conservation actions for cold water refugia. Here, cold water refugia were defined by quantitative flow volumes and their level of contrast with connected, warmer water bodies2. Such efforts could set an example for Alaska to follow in beginning to develop its own technical definitions of cold water refugia.\nExisting efforts to technically define cold water refugia have focused on needs of adult upstream migration. However, salmon at all life stages benefit from a mosaic of water temperature environments, such as when juvenile fry migrate between colder and warmer and areas to feed and digest (Armstrong et al. 2013). Thus it is recommended that future technical definitions also consider the needs of juvenile salmon."

    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nTo acquire and prepare thermal aerial infrared imagery, we worked with NV5 Geospatial1 (formerly Watershed Sciences, Inc), a contractor who has led prior efforts in the region to gather thermal aerial infrared data for aquatic habitat research (Watershed Sciences 2010). On July 5, 2020, NV5 collected thermal infrared imagery from a helicopter-mounted camera for the four steams on the Kenai Peninsula lowlands that were the focus of this study (Beaver Creek, Funny River, Moose River, and Crooked Creek). All streams were flown during the afternoon hours in order to maximize the thermal contrast between the river’s water and the banks.\nThe surveys extend for a total length of 59.1 km of the streams. Flight transects proceeded from the mouth of each stream in an upstream direction. The data were collected to aid the team in identifying the spatial variability in surface temperatures as well as thermal influence of point sources, tributaries, and surface springs.\nSpecific deliverables generated by NV5 Geospatial from the thermal imagery data include:\n\nRasters (map image files; .tif and .jpg formats)\nShapefiles (longitudinal temperature profiles, stream centerlines, others; .shp format)\nOther supplemental items (coordinates of significant thermal features, maps and figures, and others)\n\nThe full technical report from NV5 Geospatial describing detailed methods and interpretation can be downloaded at the following link in the online version of this report:\n\n\n\nDownload 'Kenai Rivers - Thermal Infrared Airborne Imagery Technical Data Report'\n\n\n The image raster files are of a large size (~3 GB) and may be acquired by contacting staff at Cook Inletkeeper (sue@inletkeeper.org), Kenai Watershed Forum (hydrology@kenaiwatershed.org), or Kachemak Heritage Land Trust (info@kachemaklandtrust.org)."

In our work, we found that 21 of these parcels contained cold water refugia features (Figure 3.1).\nIn the context of near-term potential conservation opportunities, several categories are highlighted. Several parcels belonging to the City of Kenai are recommended in the 2021 Land Management Plan for rezoning to recognize their conservation value. Our submitted comments support this goal. Additionally, the 160 acre parcel that Snowshoe Gun Club is considering for conservation easement status also stands out. We intend to continue the dialogue with the club to ensure that the opportunity for potential easement status can be easily accessed when they choose to proceed.\n\n\n6.1.2 Funny River\nFunny River runs a total of 67 river miles before meeting the Kenai River, with 4.5 of those miles in the lower section outside the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.\nThe lower Funny River riparian corridor can be described as primarily under ownership of private individuals, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (AKDNR), and the regional native corporation CIRI (Cook Inlet Regional Incorporated).\nIn the context of near-term potential for conservation opportunities, several categories are highlighted. An AKDNR parcel that parallels Funny River Road contains a significant cold water feature that we visited on foot ground truth. Future road improvement projects would ideally be cognizant of such features and take efforts to minimize impact from impervious surfaces.\nAn additional parcel owned by CIRI approximately 4 miles upstream contains a cluster of six cold-water features. This parcel also contains tributaries not currently documented as anadromous but very likely are. We intend to communicate the conservation values of this parcel to CIRI so that they may be best informed for future land management decisions.\n\n\n6.1.3 Moose River\nFunny River runs a total of 137 river miles before meeting the Kenai River, with 2.2 of those miles in the lower section outside the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.\nWe identified a minimal number of cool-water refugia features in the lower Moose River. All of these features lie on privately owned parcels. In our efforts to contact Moose River landowners to share educational materials we failed to receive responses.\nAt current time, we intend to continue seeking opportunities to communicate with Moose River landowners. Future community opportunities and events will likely present new opportunties to share our findings with specific landowners.\n\n\n6.1.4 Crooked Creek\nCrooked Creek runs a total of 45.9 river miles before meeting the Kasilof River, with 16.8 of those miles in the lower section outside the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.\nIn the context of near-term potential for conservation opportunities, several categories are highlighted. The majority of cold-water features (17/25) lie on state-owned land, and are generally clustered together in close groups.\nAn AKDNR parcel that parallels the Sterling Highway and adjacent subdivisions contains several significant cold water features that we visited on foot ground truth. Future road and home improvement projects would ideally be cognizant of such features and take efforts to minimize impact from impervious surfaces. We recommend a follow-up meeting with AKDNR officials to highlight these results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorton, J M, D R Magness, M McCarty, D Wigglesworth, R Ruffner, M Bernard, N Walker, et al. 2015. “Kenai Mountains to Sea: A Land Conservation Strategy to Sustain Our Way of Life on the Kenai Peninsula.” https://kenaiwatershed.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kenai-Mountains-to-Sea-Strategic-Plan_5nov2016_compressed.pdf."

    "text": "A.1 Water Temperature Logger Data QA/QC\nWater temperarture data retrieved from the field was subjected to a basic quality assurance process before being incorporated into the analysis dataset. We visually inspected each water temperature time series and excluded data indicative of pre/post deployment or exposure. Figure A.1 and Figure A.2 provide a visual example of water temperature time series prior to and post quality assurance processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.1: Example of water temperature time series prior to quality assurance process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.2: Example of water temperature time series after quality assurance inspection\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.1 Additional data preparation\nThe following sections describe additional details on data preparation specific to each water temperature logger site.\n\nA.1.1.1 Beaver Creek\nLoggers at the Beaver Creek logger site were deployed in early summer 2020. As part of a separate research project, Alaska Center for Conservation Science (University of Alaska Anchorage) established a logger site several hundred meters upstream also in Summer 2020.\nWe examined if data from the two sites are similar enough to use as a proxy for each other when data observations are missing. Time series from both sites are shown in figure Figure A.3, and simultaneous values from both sites are presented in figure Figure A.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.3: Water temperature time series from Lower Beaver Creek at two nearby sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.4: Regression of simultaneous water temperature observations from two nearby sites in Beaver Creek.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average absolute difference in temperature between the two logger sites in Beaver Creek is 0.06 ± 0.05 C (mean ± sd). For most applications, a substitution of data from either of these sites in Lower Beaver Creek will still accurately represent water temperature.\n\n\n\nA.1.1.2 Lower Crooked Creek\nLower Crooked Creek has two adjacent water temperature monitoring locations within 20 m of each other. Further details on these two sites are described below, and figure @fig-cc-map shows locations of the two sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.5: Lower Crooked Creek temperature monitoring sites\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.1.2.1 Lower Crooked Creek Real-time temperature monitoring site\nCook Inletkeeper maintains a site installed by Beaded Stream (Anchorage, AK) that records air and water temperature data in real-time and streams these data live at https://inletkeeper.org/our-work/healthy-habitat/real-time-temperature-sites/crooked-creek/. Water and air temperature data has been recorded and streamed from this site at hourly intervals since summer 2017.\nTemperature data from this location can be downloaded as a csv file directly from the above Inletkeeper web link. However, as of 2022-12-22 there is an error with the publicly available csv file. The publicly available csv file has incorrect time stamps after 12/31/2019. Beaded Stream staff is aware of the error, and says the remedy will require an in-person visit to the field. In the mean time, contact Beaded Stream staff to request access to most current data.\nThe data with correct time stamps from 2017-08-15 though 2021-10-26, obtained directly from the internal Beaded Stream dashboard, is also available for download at this link from GitHub: Download Lower Crooked Creek Realtime Temperature Data.\n\n\nA.1.1.2.2 Lower Crooked Creek HOBO TempPro V2 logger site\nA pair of HOBO Temp Pro V2 loggers are installed at a location 20 m upstream from the real-time temperature logger site. Water temperature is recorded at 15 minute intervals.\nDuring a site visit on 7/28/2021, we discovered that this pair of loggers potentially resided within a small, previously unidentified cold water plume incoming from the river-left bank. (On the ArcGIS Online project map, this feature is identified as “tributary_44.” It was unclear if the local cold water seep was influencing the loggers in way such that they would not represent main channel temperature.\nIn order to determine if HOBO logger data prior to 7/28/2021 is influenced by the cold seep, we performed the following steps:\n\nRelocated loggers. On 7/28/2021, we modified logger deployment such that one logger was directly upstream of the cold water seep, and one remained in its original location within the seep.\nCompared temperature data upstream vs. downstream of the seep. We observed consistently cooler temperatures in the downstream logger, with an average absolute difference of 1.47 ± 0.30 °C (mean ± sd). Figure @fig-cc-plots displays time series from both loggers as well as the difference values where simultaneous data from both locations exists.\n\nFrom these data we observe that the small cold water tributary consistently affected main stem temperature where the loggers recorded temperature. Temperature contrast was much less apparent in cooler months, after approximately September 1st, 2021. Thus, the data from these HOBO loggers prior to 7/28/2021 in the location downstream of the small cold water tributary should not be considered representative of main channel Crook Creek temperatures.\nWe reviewed all paper field forms from the lower Crooked Creek site from 2015 - present (link here) to determine the time extent that HOBO loggers may have been influenced by the cold water tributary. These notes suggest that the period extended from from 5/31/2019 - 7/28/2021. Prior to 5/31/2019 there is not evidence on file that can confirm whether or not the loggers were deployed within the cold water plume.\nOne possible explanation for why technicians failed to observe the cold water seep when they installed the HOBO loggers in Summer 2019 is that high discharge level in the Crooked Creek main channel temporarily masked the localized effect of cold water input. These results highlight the value of regular site visits to re-verify that the site is well-mixed, or checking temperatures beyond the minimum of five observations across a transect.\nAdditionally, these results exemplify the role of cold water inputs in maintaining thermal refugia for salmonids in watersheds such as Crooked Creek. Note in figure Figure A.6 that water temperature within the cold water plume in the main channel was often 1.5 °C cooler than the non-influenced location. Temperature differentials of this nature help allow salmonids to access a diverse portfolio of thermal environments important to functions throughout their life cycle such as migration, metabolism, and foraging.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.6: Water temperature time series from Lower Crooked Creek at two nearby loggers (~3 m apart). a.)
