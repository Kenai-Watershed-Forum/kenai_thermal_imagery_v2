We applied our findings of where cold-water inputs were located towards education and outreach opportunities in the Central Kenai Peninsula region. We used a variety of methods including comments on public land management plans, direct mailers, 

## Comments on the 2021 City of Kenai Land Management Plan

We used the thermal features map layer generated from this project as a tool to help generate comments on a local land management plan. We commented on the [City of Kenai 2021 Land Management Plan](https://www.kenai.city/lands/page/land-management-plan), which highlighted a number of parcels in the Beaver Creek corridor, and recommended parcel-specific actions (e.g. retain, sell, re-zone).

We created a separate map showing parcels highlighted in the plan, with management status available in a point and click format. The parcels were superimposed on a several layers highlighting ecological values such as wetlands and anadromous streams, as well as the thermal features identified in this project. Methods are described in a separate stand-alone document at <https://rpubs.com/kwf/867931>.

## Landowner Outreach

### Letter
We composed a letter addressed to landowners whose property contains cold water features that flow in to one of our study streams. This letter describes the nature of the project and the value of cold water features to salmon habitat. Landowners are invited to contact the researchers if they would like more information about their specific property.

A draft version of the letter to landowners may be accessed below:

### Postcard
We designed and mailed a post card to landowners whose property contains cold water features that flow in to one of our study streams. The postcard notifies landowners that their specific parcels are of high conservation value, and encourages them contact project scientists to learn more about best practices.
